"Battleship" network game for COSC 330

This was my first attempt at a network game. It was a class project that I completed with Charlie Sun. To play the game, run the .jar on 2 computers that are connected to the same network. 

One instance must be the host and one must join. Once a user selects host, the other user must enter the ip address of the host and the program will connect.

Next, each user must place their ships (or select the random placement button) and click ready. Each player will be notified of their turn and the game will continue until a player sins or disconnects.
